## Introduction
COVID-19 is global pandemic that has affected all of our lives to some extent. Our team has been tasked with analyzing COVID-19 data sets along with enrichment datasets in order to develop an analytical framework to study the effects and spread of COVID-19 in the US. All members of the team will have looked at datasets of county-level tracker of COVID-19 along with our individul enrichment datasets where we will perform merges, data modeling, and hypothesis testing between the COVID-19 datasets and our individual enrichment datasets. Using basic machine learning, we will develop a dashboard to report our data and findings.
## Goals
* Stage 1 - Analyze and understand patterns of the spread and effects of COVID-19 in the US
* Stage 2 - Utilize statistical modeling to prove or disprove intuitions or hypotheses gathered from COVID-19 and enrichment datasets
* Stage 3 - Utilize basic machine learning and statistical modeling in order to predict trends of COVID-19 deaths and cases
* Stage 4 - Developing a simple interactive dashboard based on the analysis done in the previous stages.
